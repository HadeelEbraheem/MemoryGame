# Memory Game Project


This project has been built by me Hadeel Alabdani , I used java script and Dom .

## Table of Contents

16 cards , Stars decreasing depends on  a counter to count your moves and a restart button to restat the game any time  ..

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
